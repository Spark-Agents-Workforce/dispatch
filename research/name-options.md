# Name Options — Orchestrator Naming Research

**Purpose:** Evaluate name options for the orchestrator agent

---

## Candidates

| Name | Emoji | Metaphor | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------|----------|------|------|
| **Dispatch** | 🚦 | 911 dispatcher / traffic control | Instantly communicates the role. "Dispatch routes, doesn't work." The traffic light emoji is perfect — green/yellow/red for go/wait/stop. | Slightly utilitarian |
| Nexus | 🧭 | Connection point | Sounds techy, implies centrality | Doesn't communicate "I don't do work" |
| Relay | 📡 | Signal relay / handoff | Clear forwarding metaphor | Sounds passive, like it just passes messages |
| Hub | 🔄 | Central hub | Simple, clear | Generic, doesn't imply intelligence |
| Signal | 📶 | Communication signal | Clean | Conflicts with Signal (the app) |
| Switch | 🔀 | Telephone switchboard | Historical accuracy | Too generic as a word |
| Conductor | 🎵 | Orchestra conductor | Implies coordination | Conductors DO work (they shape the music) |
| Tower | 🗼 | Air traffic control | Authority, oversight | Implies hierarchy/control, not routing |
| Sentry | 🛡️ | Guard / watchman | Implies protection | Wrong metaphor — we're routing, not guarding |
| Crossroads | ✖️ | Decision point | Decision-making metaphor | Too abstract |

## Analysis

The name must communicate three things instantly:
1. **Routes things** — not a worker, a router
2. **Fast** — speed is the core value
3. **Doesn't do the work** — the name itself should prevent scope creep

### Winner: Dispatch 🚦

**Why it works:**
- "Dispatch" is universally understood: 911 dispatchers, taxi dispatchers, trucking dispatchers. Everyone knows a dispatcher routes, doesn't go on the call.
- The word itself encodes the constraint: dispatchers dispatch. They don't respond to the emergency.
- 🚦 (traffic light) is the perfect emoji — controls flow, doesn't participate in it.
- Short, punchy, action-oriented.

**Why alternatives fail:**
- Nexus/Hub/Switch: communicate centrality but not the zero-work constraint
- Conductor: conductors actively shape the output — wrong metaphor
- Relay: too passive — Dispatch has intelligence, Relay implies dumb forwarding
- Tower: implies authority/hierarchy — Dispatch is a peer coordinator

## The Naming Principle

A previous orchestrator was named "Atlas" — for "holding up the world." Carrying the weight. This was the wrong metaphor. The orchestrator shouldn't carry weight. It should direct traffic. The name itself encouraged Atlas to take on too much.

Dispatch's name actively prevents this. You don't tell a dispatcher to go fight the fire.
